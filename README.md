# React + Vite

This page gives the details about the events, you can see the upcoming events also.
I used lazy loading for the upcoming events to optimize the performance of the page.

I used react-slick to display the recommended events.

## Follow the below commands in your terminal to get live in your localhost!

- `git clone https://github.com/Hasinichaithanya/eventspage.git`
- `cd eventspage`
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`

### That is it, open your terminal, you can see the link for your output, click on it.
